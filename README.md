Project Proposal Topic: "Lazatech Educate: A Web-based based Online Learning System About Lazatech Social Media Website and XRP Ledger"

Abstract:
Even for pros, the world of crypto currency is incredibly confusing. Every person who wishes to enter the crypto realm must first grasp the fundamentals and arm themselves with knowledge to avoid scams and financial loss.
 
There are several reasons why everyone must possess fundamental knowledge. Some of these factors include avoiding potential rug pull ventures and investing wisely in projects that have the potential to be successful. To address this issue, the developers want to create an application termed "Lazatech Educate" that would provide users with the necessary knowledge before entering the crypto world. "Lazatech Educate" is a web-based application that aims to provide its users with knowledge about the XRP ledger and the "Lazatech Social Media Website Application," a capstone project by Gabriel Edrian Alvaro, Marian Guerra, and Mariel Guerra. Initially, the proposed website application is an online learning website application that comprises courses and lessons about the social media application and its crypto currency integration. It would teach them how to use the capstone project social media website as well as the XRP ledger crypto trading platform.
 
This project will consist of lessons and quizzes after them. Once a user answers a question and it's correct, they will receive a crypto token to their XRP ledger address. And lastly, the user can use those tokens to avail of the Lazatech merchandise posted on the website. The crypto token that will be distributed on the platform will have a denomination of $LZT. This token is created on the XRP ledger, allowing it to be traded on the crypto exchange platform. The $LZT token, along with its partner-token $LAZA, will be used for future projects. The application and its developers will earn using the COIL platform. Coil web monetization integration would be used in the Lazatech Educate platform for the acquisition of funds for the maintenance of the application. Coil provides an alternative to traditional paid advertising for online monetization. As consumers consume content, Coil employs the interledger protocol (ILP) to broadcast micropayments. The payment channels of the XRPL are a suitable method for settling these micropayments quickly and cheaply.
